Because I have a weird football passion, hence I randomly built a Next.js web app with React, Google Cloud Platform + Firebase, and Tailwind CSS that lets users vote for football GOATs, chat with others, and enjoy a curated music playlist.

## The Inspiration Behind FVG

Football (soccer) has always been more than just a sport to me - it's a passion that transcends borders, languages, and cultures. I found myself constantly debating with friends about who the greatest football players of all time (GOATs) were. These endless discussions about Messi vs. Ronaldo, Pelé vs. Maradona, and emerging talents sparked an idea: **why not create a platform where football fans worldwide could vote, discuss, and celebrate the beautiful game together?**
