# Semester Exchange at Shanghai Jiao Tong University

My semester exchange at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)** has been an incredible journey of academic growth, cultural immersion, and exploring China. Beyond academics, I've had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience the rich culture and stunning landscapes across the country.
