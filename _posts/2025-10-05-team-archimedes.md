# Team Archimedes: Pioneering Autonomous Maritime Systems

We are a dynamic team of undergraduate innovators from **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, Singapore, dedicated to pioneering the autonomous systems of the future. Our focus is on designing and building cutting-edge **Autonomous Maritime Systems (AMS)**, which seamlessly integrate **Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs)** and **Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs)**.
