# Garage@EEE: Where Innovation Meets Community

Garage@EEE is a student-led maker space in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. We provide the environment, materials, and funding for students to develop their ideas, alongside their technical skills.

_My journey at NTU's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering - where innovation begins_

## My Experience

Garage@EEE was honestly one of the best parts of my NTU journey. It's a makerspace where we're free to build, tinker, and explore whatever ideas we have — from electronics to hardware projects, **no limits**.

### My Role: Training and Development Committee

I joined as part of the **Training and Development Committee**, where I help organize innovation events for the student community and contribute to the vibrant maker culture within our EEE community.

It was super rewarding to be part of this collaborative environment and learn alongside others while contributing to the maker community.

### What Makes Garage Special

The space is equipped with everything an engineer could dream of:
- **Soldering stations** for precision electronics work
- **3D printers** for rapid prototyping
- **Drill presses** and mechanical tools
- **Raspberry Pi & ESP32** development boards
- **Arduino ecosystem** for embedded projects

## Flagship Events

### STARTathon 🚀

STARTathon is where things get exciting. It's a chance for Garage members to come together, think big, and build a working prototype that solves a real-world problem.

**My Project**: Crop tracking system for farmers
- **Achievement**: **1st Place Winner!** 🏆
- **Impact**: Helping farmers secure funding from SMEs and VCs
- **Technology**: ESP32 + sensors + Firebase + React frontend
