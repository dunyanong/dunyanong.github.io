# Garage@EEE: Where Innovation Meets Community

Garage@EEE is a student-led maker space in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. We provide the environment, materials, and funding for students to develop their ideas, alongside their technical skills. Furthermore, we run creative initiatives to provide opportunities for our ambassadors to enhance other holistic skills.

### What Makes Garage Special

The space is equipped with everything an engineer could dream of:
- **Soldering stations** for precision electronics work
- **3D printers** for rapid prototyping
- **Drill presses** and mechanical tools
- **Raspberry Pi & ESP32** development boards
- **Arduino ecosystem** for embedded projects

### My Role: Training and Development Committee

I joined as part of the **Training and Development Committee**, where I got hands-on experience with:

#### Hardware Projects
- **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)**: Designing and assembling custom circuits
- **3D Printing**: Rapid prototyping for mechanical components  
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming microcontrollers for IoT applications
- **Electronics Integration**: Combining sensors, actuators, and control systems

#### Teaching & Knowledge Sharing
One of the most rewarding aspects was running **projectshops** where I taught:
- **ReactJS**: Modern web development frameworks
- **NodeJS**: Backend development and API creation
- **JavaScript**: Core programming concepts and applications

**Audience**: IEM (Industrial & Systems Engineering) and CS (Computer Science) students

It was super rewarding to share what I knew and learn alongside others. Teaching reinforced my own understanding while helping others start their coding journeys.

## Flagship Events

### STARTathon 🚀

STARTathon is where things get exciting. It's a chance for Garage members to come together, think big, and build a working prototype that solves a real-world problem.

**My Project**: Crop tracking system for farmers
- **Achievement**: **1st Place Winner!** 🏆
- **Impact**: Helping farmers secure funding from SMEs and VCs
- **Technology**: ESP32 + sensors + Firebase + React frontend

**The Process:**
1. **Ideation**: Identifying agricultural challenges
2. **Prototyping**: Building functional hardware/software systems
3. **Pitching**: Presenting to industry judges
4. **Funding**: Winners receive resources for further development

### Escendo 💡

Escendo focuses on **design thinking and innovation** within specific themes. It's more than just building—it's about:
- **Problem Analysis**: Deep dive into user needs
