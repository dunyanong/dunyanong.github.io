# My Hackathon Journey: Building Under Pressure

Hackathons are something I always look forward to. It's tiring for sure — sometimes 24 hours straight, no proper sleep, just coding and surviving on kopi and snacks. But the experience? **Very worth it**.

Every hackathon pushes me to think fast, work with people from different backgrounds, and build something from scratch under pressure. Win or lose, I always learn something new — whether it's a new framework, a better way to collaborate, or just how to present an idea clearly.
